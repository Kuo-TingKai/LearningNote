Many research [][][][] use Microsfot Kinect to do the skeloton tracking to estimate the traces of  joint positions/angles, and use OpenNI/Kinect OptiTrack to  construct the ground truth.
The application of these technology can be used for the  rehabitation action of buttocks/knees/shoulder. The range of motion(ROM), mean error(ME), mean error relative(MER) can be used for detection the correctness of action poses. These works use their own small datasets, but small datasets is not enough for deep learning models. The other models such like hidden markov models, dynamic time warping can be applied to the time-series data in these research.
